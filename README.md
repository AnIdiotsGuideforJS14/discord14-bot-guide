description: 'The Unoffical Discord.JS14 beginners guide, written by one idiot for beginners.'


# Welcome

## Introduction

This guides attempts to humanize the horrid discordjs 14 documentation, in it's current v14 implementation. A guide for V13 was made and had become popular, but to my knowledge they are not working on a V14 publication, so I figured that I could give it a shot.

Like the previous guide, this documentation expects a rudimentary understanding of JavaScript, so keep that in mind when going into this.

Some things to note, when I say JS14, I am referring to Discord JavaScript 14. 

This introduction is very bare-bones, I just wanted something to put here. I am unsure of how long these docs will take, as I am only one guy.
