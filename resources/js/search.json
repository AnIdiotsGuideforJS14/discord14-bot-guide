A guide for V13 was made and had become popular, but to my knowledge they are not working on a V14 publication, so I figured that I could give it a shot.","Like the previous guide, this documentation expects a rudimentary understanding of JavaScript, so keep that in mind when going into this.","Some things to note, when I say JS14, I am referring to Discord JavaScript 14.","This introduction is very bare-bones, I just wanted something to put here. I am unsure of how long these docs will take, as I am only one guy."]},{"l":"Support","p":["If you need support, just DM me! My discord is delphinium#0200"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Similar to the previous guide, this page has some FAQ's that people ask regarding JS14. These are generic examples and will do NOTHING if you insert them into your code. You must understand what they do.","In V14, there is a new enum called ActivityType, and can be used to set presence and status."]},{"l":"Examples"}]]
